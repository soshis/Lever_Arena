@definitions: - Step2: Learning to push the lever. Each time, start with 5 nose spokes to get the reward. First real lever is in low 
	position (v_pos = 0.00110, h_pos =0 .0130). Use dummy lever to draw ratâ€™s attention. Give reward when rat touches 
	the dummy lever and then when the rat puches the dummy lever. Start by putting the dummy lever at a similar level 
	than the platform and then, to prevent him using its teeth, lower your dummy lever. Once rat learned to pushes a 
	little bit the dummy lever, shift attention from dummy lever to real lever by rising the real lever to 
	h_pos = 0.00120 and finalnly h_pos = 0.00130 (threshold = 2500). The script will stop and ask if you want to rise 
	the lever after the 20th and 35th successes. press 'y' (yes) or 'n' (no) then press 'enter' to move it 
	-or not-. Once you believe rats acquire the movement step is complete. (expected time: 2 sessions).
